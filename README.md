# Frontend Mentor - Job listings with filtering

Front-end challenge focused on javascript logic, where a list of fictitious vacancies is presented and these must be filtered according to user interaction with the fields.

## About

Front-end coding challenge. [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

The challenge is to build out this job listing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories

By using this app any user can learn how they've been using their money and always keep track of your balance.
